# UAV Strategic Deconfliction System: Detailed Project Notes

## 1. Project Architecture

### 1.1 Core Components
- **Data Models (`models.py`)**: 
  - `Waypoint`: Represents a 3D point in space with optional timing
  - `Mission`: Collection of waypoints with time window and drone ID
  - `ConflictResult`: Stores conflict detection results and details

- **Conflict Detection Engine (`core.py`)**:
  - `DeconflictionSystem`: Main class that checks missions for conflicts
  - Implements spatial and temporal conflict detection algorithms
  - Provides methods for querying mission safety

- **Visualization System (`visualization.py`)**:
  - `MissionVisualizer`: Creates static and animated visualizations
  - Generates spatial views, timelines, and animations
  - Highlights conflicts with appropriate visual markers

### 1.2 Flow of Operation
1. Initialize system with known drone flight paths
2. Submit a mission for verification
3. System checks for spatial-temporal conflicts
4. Results are returned with detailed conflict information if found
5. Optional visualization provides graphical representation

## 2. Key Algorithms

### 2.1 Line Segment Distance Calculation
- Uses vector mathematics to find minimum distance between line segments
- Handles special cases like parallel lines and collinear points
- Optimized for efficient distance computation

### 2.2 Spatial-Temporal Conflict Detection
- Two-phase checking approach:
  1. First check for overlapping time windows (temporal filter)
  2. Then check for spatial proximity during overlapping times
- Interpolates positions between waypoints for continuous path representation
- Time interpolation for precise conflict timing information

### 2.3 Mission Time Management
- Automatic distribution of timing across waypoints if not provided
- Proper handling of time window constraints
- Time-based interpolation for animation and conflict detection

## 3. Technical Implementation Details

### 3.2 Conflict Detection
- Minimum safe distance parameter for conflict threshold
- Point-to-point and segment-to-segment distance calculations
- Checks all possible combinations of path segments between missions

### 3.3 Visualization Techniques

- Animation framework for time-based visualization
- Color-coding and markers for clear conflict identification

## 4. Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Unit Testing
