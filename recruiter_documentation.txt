# UAV Strategic Deconfliction System: Project Documentation for Recruiters

## Project Overview
The UAV Strategic Deconfliction System is a software solution designed to detect and visualize potential conflicts between multiple drone flight paths in shared airspace. The system implements spatial-temporal conflict detection algorithms and provides comprehensive visualization tools for drone flight safety verification.

## AI Contribution Disclosure
In the development of this project, artificial intelligence tools were utilized in the following capacity:

- **Code Implementation**: AI assistance was used to translate conceptual algorithms into Python code, including the implementation of vector mathematics, conflict detection logic, and visualization components.

- **Software Architecture**: AI provided guidance on structuring the codebase into modular components (models, core algorithms, and visualization modules).

- **Documentation Generation**: AI assisted in creating explanatory documentation and code comments.

## Personal Contribution
The key contributions I personally developed for this project include:

- **Core Concept Development**: I conceived the fundamental approach of representing drone missions as sequences of waypoints and flight path segments. The critical insight that "if two flight paths come closer than a defined safety zone (50 meters), it constitutes a conflict" was my original conception.

- **Algorithmic Concept**: I developed the conceptual framework for checking minimum distance between flight path segments rather than just discrete points, which significantly improves conflict detection accuracy.

- **Scenario Design**: I personally designed all test scenarios to demonstrate different aspects of the system:
  - **Scenario 1**: A mission that appears safe but contains a subtle conflict
  - **Scenario 2**: A mission with multiple conflicts across different times and locations
  - **Scenario 3**: A demonstration of altitude-based separation for 3D conflict resolution

- **Validation & Testing**: I designed the testing methodology to ensure accurate conflict detection across various edge cases.

- **Project Direction**: I defined the project requirements, determined feature priorities, and made architectural decisions regarding system capabilities.

## Technical Implementation Details
The system employs a modular architecture with three main components:

1. **Data Models**: Representing waypoints, missions, and conflict results
2. **Conflict Detection Algorithms**: Implementing spatial-temporal analysis
3. **Visualization Components**: Providing clear representation of results

The conflict detection algorithm uses vector mathematics to calculate minimum distances between flight path segments and integrates temporal information to determine when potential conflicts occur. The system evaluates both 2D (horizontal) conflicts and supports 3D analysis with altitude-based separation.

## Project Outcomes
The implemented system successfully:
- Detects potential conflicts between multiple drone flight paths
- Provides detailed conflict information (location, time, separation distance)
- Visualizes flight paths and conflicts through spatial plots, timelines, and animations
- Validates the effectiveness of altitude-based separation for conflict resolution

## Relevant Skills Demonstrated
This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Python programming with object-oriented design

## Learning Outcomes and Future Development
